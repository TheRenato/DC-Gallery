# DC Gallery
### Background
Experimenting with Spring Boot and Discord API. This is my try to create a Discord bot and a webpage writen in Java with the framework Spring Boot.

I have never built a site whit help of Java and never built a discord bot, so this will be a interesting project for me.

The end goal is to get images from a specific Discord channel and show it in a beautiful image gallery.

>Discord will be mentioned below as DC
### Status

##### DC
* Functional
* With the command "!gallery build" it will add the channel to the database and build the gallery.
* With the command "!gallery url" you will get the url of the channels gallery.
* You can't yet remove channel and its images from the webpage, but I will implement the remove channel with the command "!gallery remove"
* Will now ignore bots.

##### Spring
* Still, a bit messy, but working


### Future Feature

- You tell me. Put an issue, and we will se if I can implement it.
- Some admin feature would maybe be nice?
- I have some ideas, but it isn't the time to reveal them.
