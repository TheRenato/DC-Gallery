# DC Gallery
### Background
Experimenting with Spring Boot and Discord API. This is my try to create a Discord bot and a webpage writen in Java with the framework Spring Boot.

I have never built a site whit help of Java and never built a discord bot, so this will be a interesting project for me.

The end goal is to get images from a specific Discord channel and show it in a beautiful image gallery.

>Discord will be mentioned below as DC
### Status

##### DC
* Messy
* Locally got the API get Server ID and Channel ID from DC
* Succeeded to get the message attachments url.
* Decided to store some data in Databases for some persistent data. 

##### Spring
* Also, messy.
* Got it working with dynamic subpages.
* Still, no content.

### Future Feature

- You tell me. Put an issue, and we will se if I can implement it.
- Some admin feature would maybe be nice?
- I have some ideas, but it isn't the time to reveal them.
